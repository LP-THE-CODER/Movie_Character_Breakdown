Hes being wheeleddown a dim corridor by two toughlooking ORDERLIES. In one hand, he holds the recruiters crumpled BUSINESS CARD. In the other, he clutches the limited edition VOLTRON RING,  as tight as his shaky hand allows. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 111615 49. 31  They turn a corner and push through a pair of double doorsinto a cavernous room. Wade looks around, full of hope for anew life. Immediately, every single thing he seeshearsbegins to erode his confidence. The RECRUITER stands justinside the doors, smiling. RECRUITER  Mr. Wilson Nothing warms my heart like a change of someone elses. Walking into Wades P.O.V. is the creepy RECRUITER. He beams  down on Wade. RECRUITER  You finally hit fuckit. WADE Worse. Just promise you willl do right by me. So I can do right by someone else. RECRUITER  Of course. WADE Oh, and please don't make my super suit green. Or animated. Page 51119RECRUITER  I hope you enjoy your stay. The Workshop, as this old warehouse is affectionatelycalled, has been converted into a working LABORATORY. Wade is wheeled through a vast room containing rows ofindividual tents, each containing a SUBJECT. Wades eyesDART to helpless SILHOUETTES. We hear WHISPERS, WHIMPERS, MOANS. A FELLOW PATIENT, a pathetic, terrified little man namedCUNNINGHAM, is wheeled past Wade, restrained on anotherSTRETCHER. Cunningham briefly locks eyes with Wade, but  quickly moves on by. Wade cant help but be alarmed by the TERROR in Cunninghams  eyes. The tents are illuminated by BLINDING overhead lights. Wade  spies GRUESOMELY INTIMIDATING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. Wade is wheeled into the tent thats his new home. The  FIGURE who was pushing Wade DUMPS him onto a CHROME OPERATINGTABLE and roughly STRAPS him down. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 111615 50. 31  WADE  Um. My first request? A warmer table.  And warmer hands. Wade DOUBLETAKES at the sight of the figure above him ANGEL DUST  thirties, female, tall, sexy, athletic  anAmazonian warrior in another age. Angel Dust wheels over a hightech I.V. DRIP, complete withglass cylindrical tanks housing a glowing, viscous LIQUID. Then she roughly straps Wades NECK to the table. Wade  nearly GASPS, the color now officially drained from his face. WADE  Easy Arent you a little strong for alady? I am calling wang. ANGEL DUST  You had like that, huh. Welcome to our  little hospital. WADE  It doesnt look like a hospital. It  Page 52119looks like Chlamydia holding still. An UNLIT MATCHSTICK protrudes from Angel Dusts teeth  heridea of a TOOTHPICK. WADE  Oral fixation? ANGEL DUST  Shut. The fuck. Up. Angel Dust places a FINGER on Wades FOREHEAD and SHOVES hishead back against the table  BANG  pinning it there. AJAX  Patience, Angel. All in good time. Enter AJAX, whom we know as the PRISONER from the RAFT with  whom we have seen Deadpool tangle in the PRESENT. This is the  first Ajax and Wade have met. WADE  Can I expect turndown serv? Ajax nods to Angel Dust. BOOM She GAGS Wade with SURGICAL  TUBING, then wraps it around the TABLE, immobilizing hishead. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 111615 51. 31  AJAX  You are a talker. Wades eyes are wider than ever. WTF? AJAX  Mr. Wilson, my name is Ajax. I managethe Workshop. My welcome speech usedto be full of euphemisms like You mayfeel some discomfort. But I have grownblunt. Ajax unsheathes an I.V. NEEDLE. Angel Dust uptilts thetable 45 degrees, then readies a holographic monitor. AJAX  The Workshop is not a government program. Its a private institution tasked withturning reclamation projects likeyourself into men of extraordinaryabilities. I am about to remake yourlife. But if you think cancer curespainlessly, you are wrong. If you thinksuperhuman powers are acquiredpainlessly, you are wrong. Ajax touches Wade with the I.V. NEEDLE, pressing here andthere, not QUITE hard enough to break skin. At last, he  locates the subclavian vein. Wade flinches. Page 53119AJAX  We are injecting you with a serum thatactivates mutant genes. For it to work,  we need to subject you to extreme stress. The liquid glows FLUORESCENT through Wades white skin as itpumps into the pulmonary highway. AJAX  You have heard the whole makeanomelette,  breaksomeeggs bit? I am about to hurt you, Wade. The kind of  hurt I cant describe and you cantprepare for. Its cruel stuff. And  theres no way out for you. No secret  you can tell me. No soft spot in me toappeal to. Wade stares at them in shock. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 111615 52. 31  ANGEL DUST  What, you expected Weapon X? Ajax starts to TURN AWAY, but stops. AJAX  One more thing. Whats the ad? I am not  just the president. I am a client? I have  been through this procedure myself. It  made me stronger. It also scorched mynerve endings. So I no longer feel pain. In fact... I no longer feel anything.
