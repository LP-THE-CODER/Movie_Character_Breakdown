            texts = """ The story begins with Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary, living a rough but relatively content life in New York City. He spends his days taking small-time jobs, protecting teenage girls from stalkers, and generally keeping a low profile. Wade frequents Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Girls, a local bar where mercenaries hang out and take on jobs. The bar is run by his best friend, Weasel (T.J. Miller).

            One night at the bar, Wade meets Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin), a prostitute with a sharp wit. The two quickly hit it off, beginning a whirlwind romance filled with humor, adventure, and love. Vanessa and Wade's relationship deepens, and just as Wade is about to propose, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Devastated, Wade struggles with the idea of leaving Vanessa behind.

            In desperation, Wade is approached by a mysterious recruiter (Jed Rees) who offers him a cure for his cancer through a secret experimental program. The program, run by Ajax (Ed Skrein) and Angel Dust (Gina Carano), promises not only to cure Wade but also to give him extraordinary abilities. Although skeptical, Wade decides to undergo the procedure to save his life and stay with Vanessa.

            The procedure is brutal and torturous. Ajax, whose real name is Francis, and Angel Dust subject Wade to intense physical and psychological abuse, attempting to awaken any dormant mutant genes within him. The treatment involves injecting a serum and then exposing him to extreme stress to trigger a mutation. Ajax reveals that they are not heroes but are creating super slaves to be sold as living weapons. Wade's mutation eventually kicks in, giving him superhuman healing abilities but leaving him horribly disfigured with a scarred face and body.

            Fueled by anger and a desire for revenge, Wade adopts the alter ego "Deadpool." He escapes the facility by causing an explosion and vows to hunt down Ajax to force him to fix his disfigurement. Believing he is too hideous for Vanessa to love him, Wade keeps his survival a secret from her, despite still watching over her from afar.

            Wade dons a red suit and mask to hide his appearance and embarks on a mission to find Ajax. He goes on a rampage through the criminal underworld, torturing and interrogating anyone who might know Ajax's whereabouts. During this time, he encounters Colossus (voiced by Stefan Kapiƒçiƒá) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand), members of the X-Men. Colossus tries to recruit Deadpool to join the X-Men and use his powers for good, but Deadpool rejects the offer, preferring his own methods of justice.

            Deadpool finally tracks Ajax to a convoy and attacks it, leading to a brutal and chaotic highway battle. He kills many of Ajax's henchmen before confronting Ajax himself. Just as Deadpool is about to capture Ajax, Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead intervene, allowing Ajax to escape. Colossus handcuffs Deadpool and tries to convince him to change his ways, but Deadpool cuts off his own hand to escape, knowing it will regenerate later.

            Ajax learns of Deadpool's connection to Vanessa and kidnaps her to lure Deadpool into a trap. Ajax and Angel Dust take Vanessa to a decommissioned helicarrier where they plan to kill her. Deadpool, with the help of Weasel, finds out about the plan and decides to rescue Vanessa. He reluctantly teams up with Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who agree to help him in exchange for Deadpool considering joining the X-Men.

            The final showdown takes place at the scrapyard where the helicarrier is located. Deadpool, Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead fight their way through Ajax's goons. Colossus battles Angel Dust, while Negasonic uses her explosive powers to assist Deadpool. Deadpool confronts Ajax and, after a fierce battle, subdues him. Ajax reveals that there is no cure for Wade's disfigurement, enraging Deadpool further. Despite Colossus's plea to spare Ajax's life and be a true hero, Deadpool kills Ajax, much to Colossus's dismay.

            With Ajax dead, Deadpool frees Vanessa and explains why he disappeared. Vanessa, though initially shocked by Wade's appearance, still loves him. The two reconcile and share a kiss, with Wade feeling hopeful about their future together.

            The movie ends with Deadpool acknowledging his place as an unconventional anti-hero, breaking the fourth wall to speak directly to the audience. He humorously addresses his journey, the love he has for Vanessa, and his acceptance of his new identity. In a post-credits scene, Deadpool teases the audience with the possibility of a sequel and the introduction of a new character, Cable."""
